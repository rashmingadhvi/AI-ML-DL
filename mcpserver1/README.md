# MCP Server Project

This project implements an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for AI/ML/DL applications. It is designed to provide a flexible backend for model serving, context management, and integration with various client applications.

## Overview

- **Language:** Python
- **Entry Point:** `main.py`
- **Package Management:** [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (see `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`)
- **Purpose:** Serve models and handle context-aware requests using the MCP protocol.

## Features

- Implements the MCP protocol for model context management
- Easily extensible for new models and endpoints
- Can be integrated with client apps (e.g., Streamlit, web, or other MCP clients)
- Supports AI/ML/DL workflows and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) scenarios

## Project Structure

- `main.py` – Main server entry point
- `pyproject.toml` – Project dependencies and configuration
- `uv.lock` – Lock file for reproducible environments

## Getting Started

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) if not already installed:**
   ```sh
   pip install uv
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt  # or use pyproject.toml if available
   ```
3. **Run the MCP server:**
   ```sh
   uv --directory . run main.py
   ```

## Usage

- The server can be started as above and will listen for MCP protocol requests (stdio or as configured).
- Integrate with client applications by pointing them to this server's endpoint.

## Customization

- Extend `main.py` to add new models, endpoints, or logic.
- Update `pyproject.toml` to add dependencies as needed.
